In environments where verbal communication is limited or impossible—such as for individuals with hearing or speech impairments—sign language serves as a vital method of communication. However, most people do not understand sign language, leading to a communication gap in daily interactions. To bridge this gap, there is a pressing need for a real-time system that can recognize and interpret sign language gestures instantly.
The objective of this project is to develop a Real-Time Sign Recognizer using Python, which captures hand gestures via a webcam and accurately classifies them into corresponding alphabetic characters or predefined commands using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This system should be capable of processing input in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and maintaining high accuracy under varying lighting conditions and hand orientations.
